# The MRW-Simulator tool
The MRW-Simulator tool virtually simulates a model railway. As the MRW-TrackControl application it needs a preconfigured modelrailway file definition. You can add a model name to select or nothing if already preselected.

The tool simulates a good behaviour and does not simulate errors or fails.
