# MRW next generation tools
The MRW tools is a loose group of tools to make model railway life easier.

1. [MRW-Reader](reader/README.md) reads a modelrailway file and checks its integrity.
2. [MRW-Ping](ping/README.md) sends a CAN PING command and checks the responsiveness of all CAN controllers.
3. [MRW-Reset](reset/README.md) sends a CAN RESET command and waits for the reset completion.
4. [MRW-Simulator](sim/README.md) for virtually simulating a model railway.
5. [MRW-Proxy](proxy/README.md) which connects a real CAN bus to a virtual CAN bus over TCP.
6. [MRW-Tracker](tracker/README.md) for simulating a driving train while using the MRW-Simulator tool.
7. [MRW-Configure](config/README.md) for configuring the CAN controllers according to a given modelrailway file.
8. [MRW-Update](update/README.md) for updating the firmware of all connected CAN controllers.
